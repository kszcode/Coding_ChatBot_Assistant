Low hanging fruits for improvement:\n- In the `main()` function, you can add a command-line argument for the max tokens instead of using the hardcoded value in the AppState class.\n- You can add error handling for when the `key_openai.txt` file is missing or empty.\n- You can add a function to clear the conversation history if the user wants to start a new conversation without exiting the script.\n\n3. Improvements that would require a lot of work:\n- Implement a more sophisticated method for handling long conversations that exceed the model's token limit, such as intelligently summarizing or truncating the conversation.\n- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.\n- Implement a feature to save and load conversation history, allowing users to continue previous conversations.\n- Add support for other languages and models."
