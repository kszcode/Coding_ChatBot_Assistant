# ASSISTANT:
1. Bugs:
- There is a reference to the GPT-4 model in the AppState class, but GPT-4 does not exist. You should change it to "gpt-3.5-turbo" or another available model.

2. Low hanging fruits for improvement:
- In the `main()` function, you can add a command-line argument for the max tokens instead of using the hardcoded value in the AppState class.
- You can add error handling for when the `key_openai.txt` file is missing or empty.
- You can add a function to clear the conversation history if the user wants to start a new conversation without exiting the script.

3. Improvements that would require a lot of work:
- Implement a more sophisticated method for handling long conversations that exceed the model's token limit, such as intelligently summarizing or truncating the conversation.
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
- Implement a feature to save and load conversation history, allowing users to continue previous conversations.
- Add support for other languages and models.
