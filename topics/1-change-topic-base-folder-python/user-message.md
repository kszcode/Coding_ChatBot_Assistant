- now update the code so that:
1. make sure that the topic folder is relative to the current working folder
2. make sure that the response is logged in the topic folder
3. the scrachpad should be able to be an file with an absolute path, so when getting the file path check if it exists, 
   and if it does not exist then make it relative to the topic folder
