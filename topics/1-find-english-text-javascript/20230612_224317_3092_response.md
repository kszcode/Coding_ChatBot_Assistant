# ASSISTANT:
Here are the relevant texts that could show the user English text:

1. In the `startCheckout()` function:
```
$subscription.text('Unable to create subscription, please try again later.');
```

2. In the `purchaseSubscription()` function:
```
outputLocalizedText('.subscription-create-error', 'checkoutError');
ga('send', 'event', 'Digital Checkout Page', 'errlog:purchaseSubscription', 'Unable to checkout, please verify that your payment details are correct.');

outputLocalizedText('.subscription-create-error', 'subscriptionPurchaseError');

outputLocalizedText('.subscription-create-error', 'prepaidCardError');

outputLocalizedText('.subscription-create-error', 'checkoutErrorWithSupport');
```

Please note that some of these texts are used as keys for the `outputLocalizedText()` function, which might already handle the translation. If that's the case, you don't need to translate these keys, but make sure the corresponding translations are available in the localization system.
